Anderson (Ohio, USA)

30 III 68 From Harvard, entire 170g mass. Broke off small fragment. Rounded olivine, in many sized spheres from 0.3 to 1.0 cm. Some "coalesced." There seems to be a border between coalesced nodules - indicates Schreiber, or differently oriented crystal structures, or both. Thin deposits of Schreiber seem to surround olivine. The olivine only appears to occupy ~50% of area in this section, and is definitely not close-packed. One metallic area is ~1.5 cm across. Small fragment shows some surface oxidation, but not too much.

9 II 70 USNM#2177, 4.8g, Area ~ 2 cm²; polished and etched (30 sec);  
rather regular Widmanstätten pattern, band width ~0.5-1 mm; this piece contains an inclusion of Troilite and Cohenite (?) (see picture), and a small hole without oxidation products; most of the plessite shows micro-Widmanstätten structure. There are some very thin long cracks in this piece; surface slightly oxidized

Annaheim (Saskatchewan, Canada)

10 Jan 1976. 17g sample from Geol Surv. Ottawa. Polished and etched 20 sec nital. The structure is of mud, distinctness. The kam bands are difficult to orient, but the smallest are in the range of 1.3-1.6 mm, thus Oz. A few tiny 0.2 x 0.02 mm schreib inch. Plesite is ~10% of area. It is a half dark, a half banded, in several directions. No cracks, no oxidation.

No obvious carbide, silicate or sulphide.

Removed 3 mm wide block from one end, adjacent to existing cut

Much corrosion at ham. grain boundaries but  
interiors seem to be polished metal.  
Metal seems to have a frosty appearance,  
probably the result of a deep etch. We did not

Small sample from KMAU Moscow 5/7. Seems to be a hexahedrite; abundant Neumann lines, no taenite.  
Curious "whitish" mottled area in lower left - may be some sort of reheating effect. Under high power I can see many tiny (10 µm x 100 µm) rhabdites in the unreheated area, but extensive resorption and even incipient melting? (domains of clear koled 60 x 100 µm in size) in the mottled areas.

Antofagasta (Antofagasta, Chile)

13. Aug. 71. Two pieces from NMNH 1207. Both have had olivine removed. Pallasite seems to be relatively rich in metal. Olivine grains were rounded, and typical dimensions were apparently about 0.5 cm diameter. The one flat surface of the larger piece we received includes one area of clear metal about 1.1 cm across, and at least 2-3 mm thick in this section. There is a little fresh rust on the polished/etched surface, but on the whole the sample is very fresh. Minor amount of (Lochreib.) inclusions - apparently most were removed with olivine. Kam about 1.2 mm, unoriented. Swathing kam 1-2 mm across, unoriented. Dark plessite with no banding, but one big (1.2 mm) band. "merowid"

Apoala - 2nd card.

6 Jun 1966. Sample received from CNHM, Cal No. Me 1008, Wt 18.0g. Sample is flat slab ~ 1.5cm x 3cm x 1.5cm with one 0.5 x 3cm surface in very good condition from weathering. Weathering does not appear to have penetrated inward more than .01mm, however.

Several large schreib inclusions, which are extended to form cracks. Evidence of oxidation along these cracks & inclusions, inward ~ 0.1 mm. Widmannstätten pattern a bit indistinct, probably as a result of light heat treatment (or a manifestation of weathering? - I doubt it). Kamacite bands are irregular, and vary in width from 0.3 - 0.7mm. Resembles group #6 meteorites except for slightly washed out Widmannstätten pattern.

29 Jul 1966 Perry (1944) plate 47, fig 1, p.167 gives a very nice X1.2 photo of Apoala, showing a troilite inclusion and two small Reichenbach lamellae.

18.10.66, USNM, Beautiful specimen, one big 2 cm diameter troilite nodule, many long thick schreibersite inclusions.  
Bands vary greatly in width from ~0.2 to ~0.8 mm. One or 2 schreibersite inclusions have different orientation than others.

13. Dec. 65,  
Small sample (60g) from Leonard Coll. Kama band width appears to be about 1.3 mm, but the object is 0 m, not 0f. There are numerous small unidentified objects. Hor <= Apoala -pseudo

# Apoala-pseudo

Sample in Leonard collection labelled Apoala has a very indistinct Om structure, quite different from USNM and CNHM samples - see Apoala card.

13, Dec. 65. Small sample (~ 50g) from Leonard Coll. Kam band width appears to be about 1.3 mm, thus the object is Om, not Of. There are numerous small rust-filled cracks. The Widmannstätten structure is very indistinct, and it appears that the sample has been reheated.

While in Washington, I noted that Misteca, which is from the same general region of Mexico, is very similar to our sample. This would seem to be a possibility, that Mininges on a forage down south, thought that what he sought was Apoala, when it was really Misteca.

5 Sep 66. Sample observed again. Kam is polycrystalline. Kam band widths are 0.7-1.1mm, thus Om-Of. Numerous banded plessite areas are to be seen ~ 10-15% of section.

TTW 23XII 09 Piece supplied is irregular trapezoid. It seems to be reasonably fresh, though the surface has a thin oxide layer. On the sawed face I see some grain boundaries indicating kamacite lamellae. Thickness v 0.5-0.7, thus it seems to be Om, as reported in the literature. There are some five inclusions clustered together; I guess these are schreibersite. Total mass as received is 16g. From J. Zipfel, Senckenberg Mus.

Arlington (Minnesota, USA)

Pol'd+  
16 IV 68. Small, 2.4g sample from AMNH. Etched 30 sec nital.  
Curious structure. Sample consists almost entirely of kamacite with variable band widths from ~0.4 to ~0.7 mm. Kamacite bands are parallel without cross bands for more than 1 cm, suggesting a plessite field. If this is so, then the smallest bands should not be counted, and the band width can be defined as 0.5-0.7 (They give, 0.9) mm. One plessite with bands <0.1 mm occurs in one small area, otherwise the "large banded plessite" is the only type seen. At 15x + 45x I see no inclusions whatsoever. Oxidation is very light and confined to end of small specimen. I saw main mass at USNM, and it looks very fresh, like a recent fall

5/14 + 5/15 Aug '77

1 inch thick section

New error from Minnesota. Thought to be  
new sample of THE Arlington but is a TI-HAB.  
Medium octahedral, band width 1.0 ± 0.1 mm.  
Melonite has been recrystallized to a minor degree.  
There are "domain" boundary lines in the kamacite and  
many plessite fields seem to be recrystallized. Schreibersite  
is rare. No troilite seen in the section.  
Weathering has filled cracks with oxide. There are some  
squiggly "flowers" that I suspect could indicate minor impact melts.

Arltunga (Central Australia, Australia)

23 IX 70. 78.0 g slab from Brit Mus, permission to remove 2.0 g. Sample is same as that studied by Axon. The structure is very structureless plessite. There are what appear to be kamacite bands, very rectilinear, < 0.01 mm wide. They are oriented primarily as shown below, with ⟂ to the long direction of the slab, with many fewer at ± 60-70°. There are few inclusions, typically ≈ 0.02 x 0.1, unidentified. The Meteorite is fresh and relatively unweathered. A short look revealed no zone of heating near the crust, however.

Aroos (Azer.., USSR)

13 Nov 66 1.2 x 1.3 cm remnant of sample obtained from Max-Planck Institut, Mainz. Two large faces + small face between polished and etched 60 sec in nital. Very little structure. Taenite bands have disappeared in most cases, but some taenite and even plessite remains. One band which is definitely oriented is 2.7 mm wide before it disappears, another seems to be 2.2 mm. Surface has numerous black spots. Under 90x I can't tell if they are taenite, carbon, or schreibersite. No obvious cohenite is visible, but some schreibersite is present along grain boundaries. Surface has many Neumann lines. No oxidation (observed fall).

Arvorezinha

This iron is from Zucoloto. She wondered if it could be Campo and the only evidence that it is not is a high Au content.

Polishing (rough) and etching shows much evidence of oxidation, some L-shaped inclusions (bar thicknesses ~ 0.1mm, bar lengths 0.2 to 3 mm).  
I am not sure that these are. They seem to be schreibisite.*

The sample is badly corroded and the only evidence regarding boundaries is that areas outlined by corrosion have dimensions of ~ 2 mm. But the ca. 1 cm^2 sample shows no kamacite boundaries. I speculate that it may have suffered reheating.

*Perhaps these "inclusions" are taenite. One triangular area could be plessite. They occupy ~ 1-2% of the surface.
