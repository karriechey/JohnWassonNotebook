Asarca Mexicana

2 II 70 USNM no number yet, 7.1 g , Polished and etched (45 sec) Two adjacent plains, total area ~ 4 cm^2; average band width of slightly swollen Widmanstatten patterns is ~1mm; several types of plessite: coarse crystalline, fine crypto, some with minor Widmanstatten structure; some Schreibersite (or Cohenite?) in inclusions ; one thin crack containing Schreibersite , slight edge oxidation  
1.1 +- 0.2

Ashfork (Arizona, USA)

20 Aug 1967. Remnant (~5g) of sample from AMNH. Polished and etched to see vital sides of, 1.5cm^2. Clear structure  
reheating visible on mottled kamacite, but plessite is  
still very clear, as is schreib at grain boundaries. Kamacite bands ~ 0.7-1.9mm, Og. Plagioclase in beam are distinct, as are some Neumann bands. Relatively fresh specimen. No cohenite,  
graphite, troilite recognizable. Schreib along grain boundaries.  
Plessite fine, taenite between boundaries is discontinuous.

ASM004 = NWA 4703

2.2 g end piece

Medium octahedrite; bandwidth ~0.65±0.10

Etched surface is curious. Some bands are mirror-like in their brightness, others are dull. These differences clearly depend on crystallographic orientation because dull can cross bright. All bands contain abundant Neumann lines.

One small FeS inclusion on edge of kamacite, distorted diamond shape 3x9 mm.

Schreibersite not identified (and thus low). Taenite abundant and cloudy taenite abundant, perhaps 90 mg/g Ni. No heat altered zone recognized.

Apr

Medium octahedrite, well defined structure, bandwidth 0.7±0.1mm.  
Taenite relatively abundant; my guess is ~85 mg/g Ni.

My feeling is that there has been some sort shock annealing that has caused minor growth of new tiny grains in some kamacite & plessite (but this is a rough inference). No FeS, very low schreiber, no heat-altered zone.

The ridge is sharply defined; may be ventafact.  
Front; no oxide layer along this (exposed) edge. Heavily oxidized along this (bottom) edge.

ASM 010 NWA 4709 (Og)  
2.7g sample of 82g "main mass"  
Band width ~ 1.7 mm, but there seem to be some "double width" bands (as observed in IIIF). The sample is deeply etched; each kamacite band is full of Neumann lines. The kamacite contains some shiny schreibersite. There is also schreibersite at kamacite-kamacite grain boundaries - thickness up to 0.04mm, not continuous.  
No FeS. Sample very fresh, unweathered. Heat altered zone ~ 2 mm wide; only slightly heating.

JJTO 21 Feb 07

This is a medium octahedral with remarkably few inclusions. My guess is that it is low-Ni IIAB.  
The kamacite band width is ~ 0.85 ± 0.15.  
I see one round troilite with a diameter of 0.9 mm and another roughly rectangular 0.4 x 0.8 mm.

There is no heat altered zone.  
Weathering is minor to negligible. There is a small (0.2 x 0.8) dark opaque associated with an FeS that has a similar area (~ 0.15 x 1.0 mm) (on edge of)

ASM 005 = NWA 4704

Med. Oct, band width 0.70 ± 0.10. Bands are short, swollen, but no inclusions visible in the centers. I see no FeS and no schreibersite that is clearly identifiable. The sample is crossed by swell cracks showing oxidation (very minor) at edges. Plessite, mainly dark gray or finely banded, is abundant, ~30 to 55% of the area. No heat altered zone.

JTW 19 Feb 2007

This sample is an end section of a meteorite with total mass 123 g. Although the sawed face on the received mass had been polished and etched, the structure is essentially nondescript under the binocular scope. We will prepare a polished thick section to obtain more details. The structure in gray (no C particles, as in a carbon steel) but I worry that it might be terrestrial. There are fine "microrhabdite" linear features.

ASM 011 IN1945  
JTW 15 Feb 2007

Very beautiful fine orthopyroxene, barred width ~ 0.4±0.1 mm. Structure essentially the same as ASM 007.

Much phosphosilicate in the interiors of grains; almost every orthopyroxene has small phosphides with sizes of ~0.1-0.2 x 0.2 to 0.4. Some have one or two facets.

No FeS was observed.

No heat-altered zone.

ASMO12 = NWA 4711  
JTW Apr 07  
Etched on both sides. Same features on each side.  
Med. octahedrils, band width difficult to define, 0.8 +/- 0.2. The structure is strange. There is a cluster of bands running up the center of the specimen, dividing it into two "halves". I show this in pencil on the sketch.  
On the bottom side nearly all the bands are parallel in the direction shown on sketch.  
On the top side of this septum the Widman. pattern is more conventional, with 4 sets of bands.  
The sample contains lots of plessite perhaps with a range of bandwidths in most octahedral orientation. I would guess that it contains 40% plessite.  
I see no FeS and no firmly identified schreibs. However, at various locations in the central septum are what appear to be silicates. My first guess is that they are tridymite; my second guess is olivine. Typical sizes are 0.5 x 1.0 mm up to 1.0 x 2.0 mm. They appear to have been angular or faceted before a late shock event reduced the grain size and caused the faces to be slightly irregular. At the left end of...

The specimen is exceeding kamacite ~2mm wide, thus a large inclusion has been lost. There is a notch in it that contains a silicate assemblage.

Weathering is relatively minor. No heat altered zone.

Auburn (Alabama, USA)

II 70. Small (~1g) fragment (USNM 957) mounted in plastic, poly &  
etched by Buchwald. Area ~ 0.5cm². There seem to be two  
d-crystals: one central without any structure (see picture), the  
second surrounding the central shows many Neumann lines in several  
directions and contains some Fe-Ni-sulfide (?) inclusions (it would be Troilite because of absence of  
reflection). These inclusions are enriched on the borders of the two crystals; size of inclusions  
less than 1mm in length. Slight oxidation (Magnetite?) at the surface.

Avce (Italy)

27 Feb 67. Sample from Vienna, wt ~ 4g; Prior - Hey state that are is a hexahedrite fall. This is weathered octahedrite, seemingly too weathered to be a fall. Polished and etched 60 sec nital.

Prominent Neumann lines in kamacite. Plessite some fine & dark, some banded, ~ 5% of area. Numerous small inclusions in kamacite or crossing grain boundaries. I originally thought these were cohenite, but they are bronze-like troilite. I simply don't know for sure. One small 2 mm schreibersite nodule exposed on crust edge; sample weathered on "crust" side and also pitted on polished surface. Sample will not be lacquered because of pits in "troilite", which could not be cleaned once filled with lacquer. Kamacite bands 1.4 - 1.8 mm - Og.
