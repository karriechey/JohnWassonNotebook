1 Aug 66. Four pieces weighing 21 g from USNM. One thin slab was etched on two large faces (~1.5 x 2 cm each) + side. The meteorite is odd. The kamacite appears to be all one single crystal. A very large unidentified inclusion (~2 mm thick, lamellate, 1cm long before leaving section. (seems to be schreiber). There are many extremely small inclusions (?) in the kamacite, visible on both larger faces || but not on 1 side face. These "rhaboliths" are all oriented in the same direction!! Oxidation from the crust inward is negligible, less than 0.05 mm.

30/VII/68. 6.0g sample from ASU, 314.8. Pallasite. Shows very small, somewhat angular olivine fragments in addition to larger olivines which seem to be typically only ~0.4cm across. The olivine & metal are not so well segregated as in typical pallasite. Some slivering very light colored - lt green - under the microscope. Largest metallic area ~1x0.5cm, but includes several small olivine fragments. Oxidation light. Schreib difficult to identify - may be some inclusions 0.4 x 0.03 in metal. Quite a bit of silicate still in metal for chem analysis - next time use smaller pieces, look at under microscope.

13 VII 68. Sample weighing ~ 10g from V. Wisconsin. Polished and etched 30 sec nital. Kama bands quite sharply defined, wide taenite borders. Kama bands vary greatly in width, & with a gradation down to plessite bands 2.05 cm across, but approaching 1 cm in width. The "primary" bands vary from about 0.7 to 1.4 mm. Even a single, continuous band can show such variations. This suggests the difficulties which band width measurements encounter (or rapid cooling-rate determinations!). Buchwald class Om-Og. Schreibersite present as small (0.05 x 0.2 mm) inclusions, chiefly at grain boundaries, but sometimes in the bands. No other inclusions observed. Light weathering inward from crust. The structure consists almost entirely of bands, of which 80% of area could be called plessite.

Altonah (Utah, USA)

11 Nov 66. Small 1.0 x 0.5 cm sample, remnant of larger piece from USNIM. Polished and etched 30 sec in nital. Sample will be compared to Duchesne, on which I just took notes. Structure is distinct, but somewhat less so than with D. The kam bands are long, and have distinct thin taenite borders. There is a large amount of plessite, perhaps 30% of whole area, at least half of which has transformed to long kam bands ~ 1/5-1/10 thickness of reg. kam bands. The latter are typically 0.15-0.3 mm wide, thus 0% or No Oxidation, no inclusions in this small sample. * D. does not show banded plessite. I tentatively conclude that Altonah & D. are not a paired falls.

Alvord Iowa (LUSNM-5915) IN1172

15. Apr. 86. Specimen weighs 9 grams. The polished and etched surface is triangle, with three sides being 8mm, 13mm and 19mm, respectively. The bandwidth of Kamacites is about 0.24-0.60mm long, but because the polished surface and the crystal surface of kamacites is not vertical, observed the bandwidth of Kamacites is wider than real width. So, actual thickness of kamacites lamellae is about 0.28mm, perhaps it's close real width. Lamellaes of Kamacites form Widmanstätten. Taenites Occur both inside kamacites and at rim of plessite's. (Fig. 1). Plessite's Can be found in the kamacites.

There is an inclusion of chromite (?) within a polycrystalline troilite 9gm nodule.
